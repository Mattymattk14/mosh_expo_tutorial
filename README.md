# mosh_expo_tutorial

This is not my own code. I followed a tutorial by Mosh Hamedani. Visit https://codewithmosh.com for more info.

1) You will need to install expo
2) Start with "npx expo start"
3) You also need to download the app "Expo Go"

This will allow you to scan a QR code and see it on your iphone/android. You can also use the web version to see it
